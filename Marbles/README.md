<<< HOW THE GAME WORKS >>>

The idea behind the game is 2 opponents playing against each other where the winner is the first to collect 20 Marbles.
There are 2 modes: 
   - Player against the computer.
   - 1 VS 1

- In the first mode, you play against the computer and try to get all their 10 marbles in order to win.
the game starts by asking you to hide a certain amount of marbles of your choice as long as you have enough. for example if you chose 5 but you only have 6 left, the program asks you to choose a number less or equal to 5.

- the computer then hide a number of marbs and guesse if the number you hid is even or odd.

- if the computer guess is right, and the amount of marbles you hid is greater than the marbles the computer hid, the computer takes the amount of marbles they hid.
- if the number of marbles is less than or equal to computer, the computer takes the marbs you hid.
- Same thing happens if the computer is wrong. you take their marbels if you hid a greater amount and you take the amount of marbels they hid if its less or eqaul to the amount you hid.

EXAMPLE:
<<< IF THE COMPUTER IS RIGHT >>>
- You hide 7 and the computer hide 8. 
- Computer guess : ODD
- in this case the computer is right.
- YOU : 10 - 7 
- COMPUTER : 10 + 7

<<< IF THE COMPUTER IS WRONG >>>

- You hide 9 and the computer hide 3. 
- Computer guess : EVEN
- in this case the computer is wrong.
- YOU : 10 + 3 
- COMPUTER : 10 - 3

- The logic is the same in mode 2 but in this mode, 2 players play against each other.

- in this scenario, player 2 won because both hid all their marbles and player 2 guessed right.
