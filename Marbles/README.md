<<< HOW THE GAME WORKS >>>

The idea behind the game is 2 opponents playing against each other where the winner is the first to collect 20 Marbles.
There are 2 modes: 
   - Player against the computer.
   - 1 VS 1

- In the first mode, you play against the computer and try to get all their 10 marbles in order to win.
the game starts by asking you to hide a certain amount of marbles of your choice as long as you have enough. for example if you chose 5 but you only have 6 left, the program asks you to choose a number less or equal to 5.

- the computer then guesses if the number you hid is even or odd.
